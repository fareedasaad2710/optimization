"""
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning
=============================================================

WHAT IS GENETIC ALGORITHM?
- It's like evolution - start with random solutions (population)
- Select the best ones (survival of the fittest)
- Combine them (crossover - like parents having children)
- Add random changes (mutation - like genetic mutations)
- Keep the best ones (elitism - best solutions always survive)
- Repeat until we find a good solution

THE FORMULA WE USE (Same as SA):
J = w1(1 - coverage) + w2(imbalance) + penalty

GA PARAMETERS:
- Population Size: Number of solutions in each generation
- Generations: How many times we evolve
- Crossover Rate: Probability of combining two solutions
- Mutation Rate: Probability of random changes
- Elitism: Keep best solutions in each generation
