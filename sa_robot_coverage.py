Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning
==========================================================

This implements SA algorithm with:
- Weighted Sum: Combine F1 and F2 into single objective
- Neighbor Generation: Swapping cell assignments only
- Constraint Handling: Penalty functions for violations
- SA Parameters: Temperature=1000, cooling_rate=0.95, iterations=2000
