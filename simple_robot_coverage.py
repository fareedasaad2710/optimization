"""

DECISION VARIABLES:
- assignment[i][r]: Binary variable (0 or 1) - assigns cell i to robot r
- paths[r]: List of cell indices representing robot r's path sequence

OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS:
- F1: Maximize coverage (cover as many cells as possible)
- F2: Minimize workload variance (balance robot workloads)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Path continuity: Robots can only move to adjacent cells (4-neighbor connectivity)
- Boundary constraint: Robots must stay within the grid
- Obstacle avoidance: Robots cannot enter obstacle cells

The problem: Multiple robots need to cover an area while:
1. Covering as many cells as possible
2. Having balanced workloads
3. Following valid paths (no jumping, no obstacles)
