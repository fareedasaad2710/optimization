"""
Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning
==================================================================

WHAT IS SIMULATED ANNEALING?
- It's like finding the best way to arrange robots to cover an area
- Starts with a random solution (like throwing robots randomly)
- Tries small changes (like swapping cells between robots)
- Sometimes accepts worse solutions to avoid getting stuck
- Gradually becomes more picky about accepting worse solutions

THE FORMULA WE USE:
J = w1(1 - coverage) + w2(imbalance) + penalty

WHAT EACH PART MEANS:
- coverage: How many cells are covered (higher = better)
- imbalance: How different robot workloads are (lower = better)
- penalty: How many rules we broke (lower = better)
- w1, w2: How much we care about coverage vs balance

SA PARAMETERS:
- Temperature: Starts high (accepts bad solutions), gets lower (more picky)
- Cooling Rate: How fast temperature drops
- Iterations: How many times we try to improve
